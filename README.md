## Alignr: A Career Guidance System
This project implements a Career Guidance System to assist users in making informed career decisions. It leverages the KNN algorithm and combines the strengths of Next.js and Python Flask for a robust and user-friendly experience.

## About
Alignr addresses the challenge of navigating career paths by providing a data-driven recommendation system. Users can input their skills, interests, and educational background, and the system utilizes the KNN algorithm to match them with suitable career options.

## Features
- KNN-powered Recommendations: Leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to identify relevant career paths based on user-provided data.
- Next.js and Flask Integration: Combines the flexibility of Next.js for a dynamic frontend with the power of Python Flask for backend functionalities.
- User-friendly Interface: Provides a clear and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system and explore career options.

## Requirements
Frontend: Next.js framework
Backend: Python Flask framework
Libraries:
Scikit-learn for KNN implementation
Additional libraries for data manipulation and visualization (depending on your implementation)
System Architecture
(Include a system architecture diagram depicting the interaction between Next.js frontend, Flask backend, and data processing components.)

## Results and Impact
